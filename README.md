# PyEBSD-SEM
Python library for for accessing, measuring, visualizing and restoring orientation maps from SEM and EBSD using deterministic models, ML models, and hybrid models. I also leverage the Dream3D software piplines with python scripts, so that you have full access to dream3D in python with simple functions.


create a conda environment usising the environment file, ebsd.yml

download dream#D using the link 
https://dream3d.bluequartz.net/binaries/DREAM3D-6.5.171-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
extract and save in the ipf folder under pyEBSD.

You're now ready to try out the demo scripts
